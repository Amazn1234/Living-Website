# Living-Website  
> A common problem shared by many website designers is in structuring their website in a manner which makes navigation easy. As a result, attempting to find a specific page on certain websites can turn into a 15 minute challenge rather than a simple click. Our product aims to solve this problem by providing a personalized website to those who use online shopping. It is designed to create a faster shopping experience that prioritizes what the consumer may need or want to look for; it does this based on both their history and the history of other users as well. Our product may seem like just a normal recommended page that could be found on any other website, but it is more than that. Our product is unique in that the entire website will change based on the needs of the user.
