Introduction: 
A common problem shared by many website designers is in structuring their website in a manner which makes navigation easy. As a result, attempting to find a specific page on certain websites can turn into a 15 minute challenge rather than a simple click. Our product aims to solve this problem by providing a personalized website to those who use online shopping. It is designed to create a faster shopping experience that prioritizes what the consumer may need or want to look for; it does this based on both their history and the history of other users as well. Our product may seem like just a normal recommended page that could be found on any other website, but it is more than that. Our product is unique in that the entire website will change based on the needs of the user. 
Initial Value Proposition:
Our website will allow customers to find what they are looking for easily and without issue. Anyone who has shopped online knows that it can be difficult to find the right product, and it can be incredibly frustrating when these sites are not organized intuitively. Our aim is to provide an effortless shopping experience for those who enjoy making purchases online. While other sites may be a struggle to navigate, the “Living Website” will prioritize what the customer wants.

The website will be easy to navigate and will include a navigation bar with specific elements to assist the user in finding what they are looking for with as few clicks and searches as possible. Our site map and UI will be designed to be as transparent as possible to prevent frustration in navigating the site. Part of this transparency will come from things like highlighting important information and making sure the UI doesn’t become cluttered.  It will be fast and easy to access any page on the site, even if it is not one of the featured pages. This easy access for any page can be accomplished by minimizing the amount of pages and making sure the navigation bar shifts tabs to be in more accessible areas. In addition ensuring that there are proper conformation pages and data validation as well as ensuring that every link goes somewhere.  In the end, we strive to create a comprehensive website that has easy navigation and accessibility to all of its features.
